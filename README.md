# WLLN Dices

## Overview
WLLN Dices is a C++ project that simulates dice rolls to demonstrate the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN). The project aims to show how the average of the results from rolling dice converges to the expected value as the number of rolls increases.

## Features
- Simulate rolling a dice multiple times
- Calculate the average result of the dice rolls
- Demonstrate the Weak Law of Large Numbers
